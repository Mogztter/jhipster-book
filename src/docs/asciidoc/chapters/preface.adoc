Dedication
-------

I dedicate this book to my parents: Joe and Barbara Raible. They raised my sister and I in the backwoods of Montana, with fun-loving game nights, lots of walking, plenty of farm animals, an excellent garden and a very unique perspective on live. Growing up at our cabin in Montana is the most unique thing that will ever happen to me and I'm pretty pumped I got to experience it with my awesome Mom (Barb), Father (Joe) and sister (Kalin). My sister doesn't get capitalization on her title, but I did love her http://raibledesigns.com/rd/entry/my_sister_s_fabulous_wedding[wedding in 2008].
