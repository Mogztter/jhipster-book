Dedication
----------

I dedicate this book to my parents: Joe and Barbara Raible. They raised my sister and I in the backwoods of Montana, with fun-loving game nights, lots of walking, plenty of farm animals, an excellent garden and a very unique perspective on life. Growing up at our cabin in Montana was a very unique and memorable experience. 

My parents didn't seem that hip when I was a kid, but now they're some of the hippest people on the planet. Their attitudes about life, money and embracing Mother Earth are admirable and appreciated.
