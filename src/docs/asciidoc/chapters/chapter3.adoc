=== AngularJS
=== Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a CSS framework that simplifies the development of web applications. It provides a number of CSS classes
and HTML structures that allow you to develop HTML user interfaces that look good by default. Not only that, but its
3.0 version is responsive by default, which means it works better (or even best) on a mobile device.

==== The Grid System

Most CSS frameworks provide a grid system that allows you to position columns and cells in a respectable way. Bootstrap's
basic grid system is built with containers, rows and columns. It's 12 columns wide, comprised of 940 pixels (px). The grid
adapts to be 724px and 1170px wide depending on your viewport. On viewports less than 767 pixels, the columns become
fluid and stack vertically.

A basic example of the grid:

When rendered with Bootstrap's CSS, the above HTML looks as follows on a desktop. The min-width of the container element
on the desktop is set to 1200px.

[[img-bootstrap-basic-grid-desktop]]
.Basic Grid on Desktop

If you squish your browser so it's less than 1200px wide, or render this same document on a smaller screen, the columns
will stack.

Bootstrap's grid can be used to align and position elements, widgets and features of your application. It's helpful
to understand a few basics if want to use it effectively.

* It's based on 12 columns
* Just use 'md' and fix as needed
* It can be used to size input fields

Bootstrap 3's grid system has four tiers of classes: xs (phones), sm (tablets), md (desktops), and lg (larger desktops).
You can use nearly any combination of these classes to create more dynamic and flexible layouts. Below is an example of a
grid that's a little more advanced.

Each tier of classes scales up, meaning if you plan on setting the same widths for xs and sm, you only need to specify xs.

.Advanced Grid

You can use size indicators to specify breakpoints in the columns. Breakpoints specify where a column wraps onto the next
row. In the HTML above, 'md' is the size indicator. Boostrap supports 'xs', 'sm', 'md', 'lg' and 'xl'.

==== Responsive Utility Classes
Bootstrap also includes a number of utility classes that can be used to show and hide elements based on browser size.

* `.visible-[xs|sm|md|lg]`
* `.hidden-[xs|sm|md|lg]`

==== Forms
When you add Bootstrap's CSS to your web application, chances are it'll start to look better quickly. Typography, margins,
and padding will look better by default. However, your forms might look funny. This is because Bootstrap requires a few
classes on your form elements to make them look good. Below is an example of a form element.

[source,html,linenums]

----

[[img-bootstrap-basic-element]]
.Basic Form Element
image::chapter3/bootstrap/basicelement.png[Basic Form Element, 829, scaledwidth="90%"]

If you'd like to indicate this form element is not valid, you'll need to modify the above HTML to display validation warnings.

==== CSS
When you add Bootstrap's CSS to an HTML page, the default settings for typography improves right away. Your `<h1>` and `<h2>`
headings become semi-bold and are sized accordingly. Your paragraph margins, body text and blockquotes will look better.
If you want to align text in your pages, `text-[left|center|right]` are useful classes. For tables, adding a `table` class
gives them a better look-and-feel by default.

To make your buttons look better, Bootstrap provides `btn` and a number of `btn-*` classes.

==== Components
Bootstrap ships with a number of components out-of-the-box. Some require JavaScript, some only require HTML5 markup and
CSS classes to work. Its rich set of components have helped make it the most popular project on GitHub. Web developers
have always liked components in their frameworks. A framework that offers easy-to-use components often requires developers
to write less code. Less code to write means there's less code to maintain!

Some popular Bootstrap components include: dropdowns, button groups, button dropdowns, navbar, breadcrumbs, pagination,
alerts, progress bars and panels. Below is an example of a navbar with a dropdown.

[[img-bootstrap-navbar]]
.Navbar with Dropdown
image::chapter3/bootstrap/navbar-with-dropdown.png[Navbar, 867, scaledwidth="100%"]

When rendered on a mobile device, everything collapses into a hamburger menu that can be expanded downward.

[[img-bootstrap-navbar-mobile]]
.Navbar on Mobile
image::chapter3/bootstrap/navbar-on-mobile.png[Navbar, 467, scaledwidth="50%"]

This navbar requires quite a bit of HTML markup, so it's not shown here for the sake of brevity. You can view this source
online in http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar-default[Bootstrap's documentation]. A simpler example is below that
shows the basic structure.

[source,html,linenums]

Alerts are useful for displaying feedback to the user. Different colors are made possibly with different classes. You'll need
to add an `alert` class, plus `alert-[success|info|warning|danger]` to indicate the colors.

[source,html,linenums]

include::{sourcedir}/../webapp/chapter3/bootstrap/alerts.html[]
----

This renders alerts like the ones you see in below:

[[img-bootstrap-alerts]]
.Alerts
image::chapter3/bootstrap/alerts.png[Alerts, 828, scaledwidth="100%"]

To make an alert closeable, you need to add an `.alert-dismissible` class and a close button.

[source,html,linenums]
----
<div class="alert alert-warning alert-dismissible" role="alert">
  <button type="button" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="Close"><span aria-hidden="true">&times;</span></button>
  <strong>Warning!</strong> Better check yourself, you're not looking too good.
</div>
----

.Closeable Alert

TIP: To make links in your alerts match the colors of the alert, use `.alert-link`.

=== BrowserSync

http://www.browsersync.io/[BrowserSync] is one of those tools that make you wonder how you ever lived without them. It's a program that
keeps your assets in sync with your browser. It's also capable of syncing browsers, so you can scroll in
Safari and watch a Chrome window scroll, along with a Safari window running in iOS Simulator. When you save
files, it updates your browser windows, saving you an incredible amount of time. As its website says:
"It's wicked-fast and totally free".

BrowserSync is free to run and reuse, as guaranteed by its open source Apache 2.0 License. It contains a number of slick features:

* Interaction sync: Your scroll, click, refresh and form actions are mirrored between browsers while you test.
* File sync: Browsers are automatically updated as you change HTML, CSS, images and other project files.
* URL history: Records your test URLs so you can push them back out to all devices with a single click.
* Remote inspector: Remotely tweak and debug web pages that are running on connected devices.
* Browser support: Instantly sync between your desktop, tablet and phone. Perfect for coding responsive designs.
* Build-tool compatible: Easily integrated with task runners like Grunt and Gulp, or included in other Node projects.
* Install and run anywhere: Built on Node.js to support Windows, MacOS and Linux. Setup in less than 5 minutes.

To integrate BrowserSync in your project, you need a `package.json` and `Gruntfile.js`. Your `package.json` file only needs
to contain a few things, weighing in at a slim 15 lines of JSON.

[source,javascript,linenums]

The `Gruntfile.js` utilizes the tools specified in `package.json` to enable BrowserSync and create a magical web development
experience.

[source,javascript,linenums]
----
include::{sourcedir}/../../../Gruntfile.browsersync.js[]
----

After you've created these files, you'll need to install https://nodejs.org/[Node] and its package manager (NPM). Then you
should be able to run the following command to install BrowserSync and Grunt. You will only need to run this command when
dependencies change in `package.json`.
----
npm install
----
You may have to install http://gruntjs.com/[Grunt] as well. Install the grunt command-line tool globally with:
----
npm install -g grunt-cli
----
Then run the following command to create a blissful development experience where your browser auto-refreshes when files change
on your hard drive.
----
grunt serve
----
For an audio visual introduction to BrowserSync, check out the introduction video on its http://www.browsersync.io/[homepage].

JHipster integrates BrowserSync for you, using JavaScript similar that looks very similar to what you see above. Integrating
BrowserSync into your project is highly recommended. It's also useful for determining if your web application can handle a
page reload without losing the current user's state.
