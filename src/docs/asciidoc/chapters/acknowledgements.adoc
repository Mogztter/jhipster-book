== Acknowledgements

I'm extremely grateful to my family, for putting up with my late nights and extended screen time while I worked on this book.

I'd also like to thank this book's tech editors: Dennis Sharpe and Kile Niklawski. Their real-world experience with JHipster made the code sections a lot more bulletbroof.

Finally, kudos to Julien Dubois for creating JHipster and turning it into a widely-used, successful open source project.
