== About the Author

Matt Raible is a Java Hipster. He grew up in the backwoods of Montana with no electricty or running water. He walked a mile and half to the bus stop on school days. His mom and sister were often leading the early morning hikes, but his BMX skills overcame this handicap later in life.

He started writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the early 90s and got into Java in the late 90s. He loves the Volkswagen Bus, like no one should love anything. It's wierd. He has a passion for skiing, mountain biking, VWs and good beer. Matt is married to an awesome woman and amazing photographer, http://www.mcginityphoto.com/[Trish McGinity]. They love skiing, rafting and camping with their awesome kids, Abbie and Jack.

=== Acknowledgements

I'm extremely grateful to my family, for putting up with my late nights and extended screen time while I worked on this book.

I'd also like to thank this book's tech editors: Dennis Sharpe and Kile Niklawski. Their real-world experience with JHipster made the code sections a lot more bulletbroof.

Finally, kudos to Julien Dubois for creating JHipster and turning it into a widely-used, successful open source project.
