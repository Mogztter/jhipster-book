About the Author
----------------

Matt Raible is a Java Hipster. He grew up in the backwoods of Montana with no electricty or running water. He walked a mile and half to the bus stop on school days. His mom and sister were often leading the early morning hikes, but his BMX skills overcame this handicap later in life.

He started writing HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the early 90s and got into Java in the late 90s. He loves the Volkswagen Bus, like no one should love anything. It's wierd. He has a passion for skiing, mountain biking, VWs and good beer. Matt is married to an amazing photographer, http://www.mcginityphoto.com/[Trish McGinity]. They love skiing, rafting and camping with their awesome kids, Abbie and Jack.

Matt pays a lot to fantasize about driving a 1966 Deluxe Samba. In the meantime, he's extremely happy with Trish's 1990 Vanagon Syncro.
