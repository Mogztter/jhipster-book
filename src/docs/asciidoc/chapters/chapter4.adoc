=== Spring Boot

//image::images/chapter4/spring-boot-logo.png[Spring Boot Logo, 150, 150, float="right"]

In August 2013, the Phil Webb and Dave Syer, Engineers at Pivotal,
https://spring.io/blog/2013/08/06/spring-boot-simplifying-spring-for-everyone[announced the first milestone release] of Spring
Boot. Spring Boot makes it easy to create Spring applications with minimal effort. It takes an opinionated
view of Spring and auto-configures dependencies for you. This allows you to write less code, but still harness
the power of Spring. The diagram below shows how Spring Boot is the gateway to the larger Spring ecosystem.

[[img-spring-boot-pyramid]]

image::images/chapter4/spring-boot-pyramid.png[Spring Boot, 379, scaledwidth="50%", align=center]

The primary goals of Spring Boot are:

* To provide a radically faster and widely accessible 'getting started' experience for all Spring development.
* To be opinionated out of the box, but get out of the way quickly as requirements start to diverge from the defaults.
* To provide a range of non-functional features that are common to large classes of projects
  (e.g. embedded servers, security, metrics, health checks, externalized configuration).

For folks wanting to use Spring Boot outside of a JHipster application, this can be done by using Spring Initializr.
Spring Initializr is a configurable service for generating Spring projects. It's both a web application and a REST API.
You can visit it in your browser at https://start.spring.io or you can call it via `curl`.

Spring Initializr is an Apache 2.0-licensed open source project that install and customize for generating Spring
projects for your company or team. You can find it on GitHub at https://github.com/spring-io/initializr.

Spring Initializr is also available in the Eclipse-based https://spring.io/tools/sts[Spring Tool Suite (STS)] and
https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA].

.Spring CLI
****
At the bottom of the start.spring.io page, you can also download or install the Spring CLI (also called the Spring Boot CLI).
The easiest way to install it is using the following command.

----
curl https://start.spring.io/install.sh | sh
----

Spring CLI is best used for rapid prototyping; when you want to show someone how to do something _very_ quickly, and you'll
likely throw away the code when you're done. For example, if you want to create a "Hello World" web application in Groovy,
you can do it with seven lines of code.

[source,groovy]
.hello.groovy
----
@RestController
class WebApplication {
    @RequestMapping("/")
    String home() {
        "Hello World!"
    }
}
----

To compile and run this application, simply type:

----
spring run hello.groovy
----

After running this command, you can see the application at http://localhost:8080. For more information about the
Spring CLI, see the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/cli-using-the-cli.html[Spring Boot documentation].
****

To show you how to create a simple application with Spring Boot, go to https://start.spring.io and select `Web`, `JPA`,
`H2` and `Actuator` as project dependencies. Click *Generate Project* to download a .zip file for your project. Extract
it onto your hard drive and import it into your favorite IDE.

This project has only a few files in it, as you can see by running the `tree` command (on *nix).

----
.
├── pom.xml
└── src
    ├── main
    │   ├── java
    │   │   └── demo
    │   │       └── DemoApplication.java
    │   └── resources
    │       ├── application.properties
    │       ├── static
    │       └── templates
    └── test
        └── java
            └── demo
                └── DemoApplicationTests.java

10 directories, 4 files
----

`DemoApplication.java` is the heart of this application, the file and class name are not relevant. What is relevant
is the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation and the class's `public static void main` method.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/demo/DemoApplication.java
----
package demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----

For this application, you'll create an entity, a JPA repository and a REST endpoint to show data in the browser. To
create an entity, add the following code to the `DemoApplication.java` file, outside of the `DemoApplication` class.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/demo/DemoApplication.java
----
@Entity
class Blog {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }

    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Blog{" +
                "id=" + id +
                ", name='" + name + '\'' +
                '}';
    }
}
----

In the same file, add a `BlogRepository` interface that extends `JpaRepository`. Spring Data JPA makes it really easy to
create a CRUD repository for an entity. The implementation that talks to the underlying datastore is created automatically for you.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/demo/DemoApplication.java
----
interface BlogRepository extends JpaRepository<Blog, Long> {}
----

Define a `CommandLineRunner` that injects this repository and prints out all the data that's found by calling its `findAll()` method.
`CommandLineRunner` is an interface that's used to indicate that a bean should run when it is contained within a
http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/SpringApplication.html[`SpringApplication`].

[source,java]
.src/main/java/demo/DemoApplication.java
----
@Component
class BlogCommandLineRunner implements CommandLineRunner {

    @Override
    public void run(String... strings) throws Exception {
        System.out.println(repository.findAll());
    }

    @Autowired
    private BlogRepository repository;
}
----

To provide default data, create `src/main/resources/data.sql` and add a couple SQL statements to insert data.

[source,sql]
.src/main/resources/data.sql
----
insert into blog (name) values ('First');
insert into blog (name) values ('Second');
----

Start your application with `mvn spring-boot:run` (or right-click -> run in your IDE) and you should see this default
data show up in your logs.

----
2015-09-21 06:00:07.056  INFO 6140 --- [           main] s.b.c.e.t.TomcatEmbeddedServletContainer : Tomcat started on port(s): 8080 (http)
[Blog{id=1, name='First'}, Blog{id=2, name='Second'}]
2015-09-21 06:00:07.210  INFO 6140 --- [           main] demo.DemoApplication                     : Started DemoApplication in 4.794 seconds (JVM running for 5.238)
----

To publish this data as a REST API, create a `BlogController` class and add a `/blogs` endpoint that returns a list of blogs.

[source,java]
.src/main/java/demo/DemoApplication.java
----
@RestController
class BlogController {

    @RequestMapping("/blogs")
    Collection<Blog> list() {
        return repository.findAll();
    }

    @Autowired
    BlogRepository repository;
}
----

After adding this code and restarting the application, you can `curl` the endpoint or open it in your
favorite browser.

----
$ curl localhost:8080/blogs
[{"id":1,"name":"First"},{"id":2,"name":"Second"}]
----

Spring has one of the best track records for hipness in JavaLand. It is an essential cornerstone of the solid API foundation
that makes JHipster awesome. Spring Boot allows you to create stand-alone Spring applications that embed Tomcat, Jetty or
Undertow directly. It provides opinionated _starter_ dependencies that simplify your build configuration, regardless of
whether you're using Maven or Gradle.

Spring Boot is unique in that it automatically configures Spring whenever possible. It does this by peaking into JAR
files to see if they're hip. If they are, they contain a `META-INF/spring.factories` that defines configuration classes
under the `EnableAutoConfiguration` key. For example, below is what's contained in `spring-boot-actuator`:

.spring-boot-actuator.jar!/META-INF/spring.factories
----
org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration=\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.AuditAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.CrshAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.EndpointAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.EndpointMBeanExportAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.EndpointWebMvcAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.HealthIndicatorAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.JolokiaAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.ManagementSecurityAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.ManagementServerPropertiesAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.MetricFilterAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.MetricRepositoryAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.PublicMetricsAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.TraceRepositoryAutoConfiguration,\
org.springframework.boot.actuate.autoconfigure.TraceWebFilterAutoConfiguration
----

These configuration classes will usually contain `@Conditional` annotations to help configure themselves. Using
`@ConditionalOnMissingBean` is used commonly to allow developers to override the auto-configured defaults. There are several
conditional-related annotations you can use when developing Spring Boot plugins:

* `@ConditionalOnClass` and `@ConditionalOnMissingClass`
* `@ConditionalOnMissingClass` and `@ConditionalOnMissingBean`
* `@ConditionalOnProperty`
* `@ConditionalOnResource`
* `@ConditionalOnWebApplication` and `@ConditionalOnNotWebApplication`
* `@ConditionalOnExpression`

These annotations are what gives Spring Boot its immense power and makes it easy to use, configure and override.

==== Actuator
Spring Boot's Actuator sub-project adds several production-grade services to your application with little effort.
You can add the actuator to a Maven-based project by adding the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency.

----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

If you're using Gradle, you'll save a few lines:

----
dependencies {
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator")
}
----

Actuator's main features are *endpoints*, *metrics*, *auditing*, and *process monitoring*. Actuator auto-creates a
number of REST endpoints. By default Spring Boot will also expose management endpoints as JMX MBeans under the
`org.springframework.boot` domain. Actuator REST endpoints include:

* `/autoconfig` - Returns an auto-configuration report showing all auto-configuration candidates.
* `/beans` - Returns a complete list of all the Spring beans in your application.
* `/configprops` - Returns a list of all @ConfigurationProperties.
* `/dump` - Performs a thread dump.
* `/env` - Returns properties from Spring's ConfigurableEnvironment.
* `/health` - Returns application health information.
* `/info` - Returns basic application info.
* `/metrics` - Returns performance information for the current application.
* `/mappings` - Returns a  list of all `@RequestMapping` paths.
* `/shutdown` - Shuts the application down gracefully (not enabled by default).
* `/trace` - Returns trace information (by default the last several HTTP requests).

JHipster includes a plethora of Spring Boot starter dependencies by default. This allows developers write less code and worry
less about dependencies and classpaths. The _boot starter_ dependencies in the 21 Points Health application are as follows:

----
spring-boot-actuator
spring-boot-autoconfigure
spring-boot-loader-tools
spring-boot-starter-logging
spring-boot-starter-aopspring-boot-starter-data-jpa
spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch
spring-boot-starter-security
spring-boot-starter-web
spring-boot-starter-websocket
spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf
spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-connector
spring-cloud-spring-service-connector
spring-cloud-localconfig-connector
spring-security-config
spring-security-data
spring-security-web
spring-security-messaging
----

Spring Boot does a great job at auto-configuring libraries and simplifying Spring. JHipster complements that by
integrating the wonderful world of Spring Boot with a modern UI and developer experience.

=== Maven vs. Gradle

Maven and Gradle are the two main build tools used in Java projects today. JHipster allows you to use either one.
With Maven, you have one `pom.xml` file that's around 800 lines of XML. With Gradle, you end up with nine *.gradle files.
However, their Groovy code adds up to 344 lines.

http://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] calls itself a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the
concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a
central piece of information. Most of Maven's functionality is in plugins. There are Maven plugins for building,
testing, source control management, running a web server, generating IDE project files, and much more.

https://gradle.org/[Gradle] is a general-purpose build tool. It can build pretty much anything you care to implement in your build script. Out-of-the-box, however, it doesn't build anything unless you add code to your build script to do so. Gradle has a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) instead of the more traditional XML form of declaring the project configuration. Like Maven, Gradle has _plugins_ that allow you to configure tasks for your project. Most plugins add some pre-configured tasks which together do something useful. For example, Gradle's Java plugin adds some tasks to your project which will compile and unit test your Java source code, as well as bundle it into a JAR file.

In January 2014, ZeroTurnaround's RebelLabs published a report titled http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/java-build-tools-part-2-a-decision-makers-comparison-of-maven-gradle-and-ant-ivy/[Java Build Tools – Part 2: A Decision Maker’s Comparison of Maven, Gradle and Ant + Ivy]. In the report, they provided a timeline of build tools from 1977 through 2013.

[[img-evolution-of-build-tools-timeline]]
.The Evolution of Build Tools, 1977 - 2013
image::images/chapter4/evolution-of-build-tools-timeline.jpg[The Evolution of Build Tools, 600, scaledwidth="100%", align=center]

The report concludes that you should experiment with Gradle for your next project.

[, 'RebelLabs Comparison of Maven, Gradle and Ant + Ivy']
""
If we were forced to conclude with any general recommendation, it would be to *go with Gradle if you are starting a new project*.
""

I've used both tools for building projects and they've both worked quite well. Maven has worked quite well for me, but I've also used it for over 10 years and recognize that my history and experience with it might contribute to my bias towards it. If it's Maven's XML that you hate, you can use https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven[Polyglot for Maven] to change your perspective. It supports Atom, Groovy, Clojure, Ruby, Scala and YAML languages. Ironically, you need to include an XML file to use it. To add support for non-XML languages, create a `${project}/.mvn/extensions.xml` file and add the following XML to it.

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<extensions>
  <extension>
    <groupId>io.takari.polyglot</groupId>
    <artifactId>${artifactId}</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.10</version>
  </extension>
</extensions>
----

In this example, `${artifactId}` should be `polyglot-_language_`, where _language_ is one of the aforementioned languages.

To convert an existing `pom.xml` file to another format, you can use the following command:

----
mvn io.takari.polyglot:polyglot-translate-plugin:translate \
  -Dinput=pom.xml -Doutput=pom.${format}
----

Supported formats are `rb`, `groovy`, `scala`, `yaml`, `atom` and of course `xml`. You can even convert back to xml or cross-convert between all supported formats. To learn more about alternate languages with Maven, see https://github.com/takari/polyglot-maven[polyglot-maven on GitHub].

If you're still not convinced, there's a lot of internet resources that support the use of Gradle. First, there's Gradle Inc.'s https://gradle.org/maven_vs_gradle/[Gradle vs Maven Feature Comparison].
There's also a "http://www.drdobbs.com/jvm/why-build-your-java-projects-with-gradle/240168608[Why Build Your Java Projects with Gradle]" by Benjamin Muschko, on Dr. Dobb's. Benjamin is a Principal Engineer at Gradle Inc. and the author of https://www.manning.com/books/gradle-in-action[Gradle in Action].

Gradle is the default built tool for the Android development. Android Studio uses a Gradle wrapper to fully integrate the Android plugin for Gradle.

TIP: Both Maven and Gradle provide wrappers that allow you to embed the build tool within your project and source control system. This allows developers to build/run the project by only installing Java. Since the build tool is embedded, they can type `gradlew` or `mvnw` to use the embedded built tool.

Regardless of which build tool you prefer, Spring Boot provides support for both Maven and Gradle. You can learn more by visiting their respective documentation pages:

* http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html[Spring Boot Maven plugin]
* http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-gradle-plugin.html[Spring Boot Gradle plugin]

I'd recommend starting with whatever tool is most familiar to you. If you're using JHipster for the first time, you'll want to reduce the number of new technologies you're learning. You can always add additional ones in your next application. JHipster is a great learning tools, so you can also re-generate your project with the alternate build tool to see what that looks like.

=== IDE Support: Running, Debugging and Profiling

IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is the lifeblood of a programmer that likes keyboard shortcuts and typing fast. The good ones have code completion that allows you to type a few characters, press tab, and have your code written for you. Furthermore, they provide quick formatting, easy access to documentation, debugging and code generation. With statically typed languages like Java, you can generate a lot of code with your IDE. For example, getters and setters on POJOs, and methods in interfaces and classes. You can also find references to methods easily.

https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA] brings this same features to Java development and is a truly amazing IDE. If you're only writing JavaScript, their https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/[WebStorm IDE] will likely become your best friend. Both IntelliJ products have excellent CSS support and there's plugins for many web languages/frameworks.

The Java IDE from Eclipse is a free alternative to IntelliJ IDEA. It's Java and refactoring support is excellent. When I started using it back in 2002, it blew the competition away. It was the first Java IDE that was fast and efficient to use. Unfortunately, it hasn't caught up in the JavaScript MVC era and does not have good support for JavaScript or CSS.

NetBeans has a https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/new_spring_boot_integration_for[Spring Boot plugin]. The NetBeans Team has been doing a lot of work recently on web tools support; they have good JavaScript/AngularJS support and there's a https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/netbeans-connector/hafdlehgocfcodbgjnpecfajgkeejnaa?hl=en[NetBeans Connector] plugin for Chrome that allows two-way
editing in NetBeans and Chrome.

The JHipster documentation includes https://jhipster.github.io/configuring_ide.html[guides] for configuring https://jhipster.github.io/configuring_ide_eclipse.html[Eclipse] and https://jhipster.github.io/configuring_ide_idea.html[IntelliJ IDEA].

The beauty of Spring Boot is you can run it as a simple Java process. This means you can right click on your `*Application.java` class and run it (or debug it) from your IDE. When debugging, you'll be able to set breakpoints in your Java classes and see what variables are being set to before a process executes.

To learn about profile a Java application, I recommend you watch http://www.meetup.com/virtualJUG/events/225557121/[Nitsan Wakart's Java Profiling from the Ground Up!] To learn more about memory and JavaScript applications, I recommend http://addyosmani.com/blog/video-javascript-memory-management-masterclass/[Addy Somani's JavaScript Memory Management Masterclass].
// MR: The Java Profiling URL will likely change once the video is published

=== Security

Spring Boot has excellent security features thanks to its integration with Spring Security. When you create a Spring Boot application with a `spring-boot-starter-security` dependency, you get HTTP Basic authentication out-of-the-box. By default, a user is created with username `user` and the password is printed in the logs when the application starts. To override the generated password, you can define a `security.user.password`. Additional security features of Spring Boot can be found in the http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-security.html[Spring Boot Security Guide].

The most basic Spring Security Java configuration creates a Servlet Filter, which is responsible for all the security (protecting URLs, validating credentials, redirecting to login, etc.). This involves several lines of code, but half of them are class imports.

[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.authentication.builders.*;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.*;

@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {
    @Autowired
    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {
        auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
            .withUser("user").password("password").roles("USER");
    }
}
----

There's not much code, but it provides many features:

* Requires authentication to every URL in your application
* Generates a login form for you
* Allows _user:password_ to authenticate with form based authentication
* Allows the user to logout
* CSRF attack prevention
* Session Fixation protection
* Security Header integration
** HTTP Strict Transport Security for secure requests
** X-Content-Type-Options integration
** Cache Control
** X-XSS-Protection integration
** X-Frame-Options integration to help prevent Clickjacking
* Integrates with HttpServletRequest API methods: `getRemoteUser()`, `getUserPrinciple()`, `isUserInRole(role)`, `login(username, password)` and `logout()`

JHipster takes the excellence of Spring Security and used it to provide the real-world authentication mechanism that applications need. When you create a new JHipster project, it provides you with three authentication options:

* *HTTP Session Authentication*: Uses the HTTP Session, so it is a stateful mechanism. Recommended for small applications.
* *OAuth2 Authentication*: A stateless security mechanism; you might prefer it if you want to scale your application across several machines.
* *Token-based authentication*: Like OAuth2, a stateless security mechanism. Specific to JHipster, not provided by Spring Security.

Below are examples of what each authentication mechanism looks like in a bare-bones JHipster application.
